Authors: Annie Tran, Ivan Cvjetinovic, Nikko Sanchez, Wanzhu Zheng

## Information

Hello and welcome to our ECS 171 project! Here are the steps to run the Streamlit website:

1. Make sure that you have the proper dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
2. Move to the 'frontend' directory (`cd annie-repo/frontend`)
3. Run the script with the following command: `streamlit run main.py`

Once you are in the website, feel free to run your provided information on the model to determine whether or not you have Type II Diabetes.

If you would like to run our notebook, please make sure to upload it to your Google Drive. In order for the notebook to work, you will need to configure the Google Drive filepath (location in code below) so that it can properly identify the Pima Diabetes dataset. If you need the dataset, a copy can be found under 'colab_notebooks/dataset.'
